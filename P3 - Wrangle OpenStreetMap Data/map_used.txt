I downloaded a preselected metro area from Map Zen, it is an open source mapping lab building mapping tools and services, among the available map, given that I'm italian and live in the village, it is just 50 km from Milan, I chose that of the city of Milan and urban agglomeration around it, https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/milan_italy/. Specically, the map includes the Metropolitan City of Milan and, partially, the territories of the province of Monza and Brianza, Varese, Como, Lecco, Lodi and Pavia. The Metropolitan City of Milan is a metropolitan city in the Lombardy region, Italy. Its capital is the city of Milan. It replaced the Province of Milan and includes the city of Milan and other 133 municipalities.
